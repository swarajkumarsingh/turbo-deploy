# Turbo Deploy üöÄ

Turbo Deploy is an enterprise-grade deployment platform that automates the entire process of deploying React/Vite applications. With a single Git URL, it orchestrates building, hosting, and serving your application through a sophisticated AWS infrastructure pipeline. This project is built using Go, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and several AWS services, including RDS, S3, ElasticCache, SES, SQS, ECS, and EC2.

## Project Structure

The Turbo-Deploy project is built with a modular structure to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of development. Below is a breakdown of the key directories and their roles:

### **/controller**  
Contains the logic for handling incoming requests and orchestrating business processes.  
- **prometheus**: Custom Prometheus metrics for real-time monitoring and observability.  
- **user**: Handles user-specific operations like authentication, user profile management, and access control.  

### **/docs**  
Houses project documentation, API references, and technical guides.  

### **/errorHandler**  
Centralized error-handling mechanism used throughout the application to ensure consistency and structured error responses.  

### **/functions**  
A collection of utility modules to handle common tasks across services:  
- **general**: Generic utilities used in various modules.  
- **logger**: Custom logging utilities for structured and level-based logging.  
- **retry**: Helper functions for implementing retry logic for failed operations.  
- **tracer**: OpenTelemetry tracing utilities for distributed system observability.  
- **uploader**: Tools for handling file uploads to S3.  
- **validator**: Input validation functions to enforce data integrity.  

### **/infra**  
Infrastructure-specific modules that abstract interactions with external services:  
- **db**: PostgreSQL database connection and query abstraction.  
- **redis**: Integration with AWS ElasticCache for caching.  
- **s3**: S3 bucket management and operations for file storage.  
- **ses**: Email sending functionalities via AWS SES.  
- **sqs**: Integration with AWS SQS for event queue management.  

### **/migrations**  
Scripts for managing database schema migrations. Ensures smooth transitions when modifying the database schema.  

### **/models**  
Defines the data models and business logic for various entities:  
- **deployment**: Manages deployment processes and state.  
- **deployment_log**: Tracks deployment history and logs.  
- **error**: Standardized error model for the system.  
- **project**: Handles project-related data and logic.  
- **user**: User-specific data and operations.  

### **/routes**  
Defines API routes and their mapping to controller functions. Acts as the entry point for incoming requests.  

### **/services**  
Contains microservices, each performing specific roles:  
- **build-server**: Executes ECS tasks to clone repositories, build projects, and upload artifacts to S3.  
- **email-consumer**: Listens to SQS queues and sends email notifications using AWS SES.  
- **logs-sqs-consumer**: Processes logs/events from the SQS queues and updates deployment logs or metrics.  
- **reverse-proxy**: Dynamically serves files from S3 based on subdomains.
