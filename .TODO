## Create 3 components

### Code Builder(ec2 launch)
    - Launch a AWS ECS task(pre-configured)

### Docker Build to compile and push to s3

### Proxy from golang to s3

1. Read git clone, package.json and check for mf hackers!




# Extra
1. When AWS ECS sever is down, will build user project in main server
2. in script.js, don't use sync function, use async functions
3. DONE - use promise to upload files, use p-concurrency package 
4. use cloudfront from reverse-proxy
